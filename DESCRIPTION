Description: devil is an R package for fast, scalable differential expression analysis of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data. It is designed to operate directly at the cell level while accounting for complex experimental structure. It employs a statistical framework based on generalized linear models with cluster-robust (sandwich) covariance estimators, enabling valid inference in the presence of multi-patient, multi-sample, or repeated-measurement designs. To support analyses at atlas scale, devil combines efficient variational inference with optional GPU acceleration, delivering substantial gains in runtime and memory efficiency while retaining accurate and well-calibrated statistical tests.
