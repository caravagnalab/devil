This tutorial guides you through the use of the `devil` package for analyzing differential gene expression in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the required packages installed

```{r setup}
library(devil)
library(scRNAseq)
```

### Loading and preparing your data

Let's start by loading a sample dataset from the `scRNAseq` package

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the example dataset
data <- scRNAseq::BaronPancreasData()

# Extract counts and metadata
counts <- data@assays@data[[1]]
metadata <- data@colData

# Display dataset dimensions
cat("Number of genes:", nrow(counts), "\n")
cat("Number of cells:", ncol(counts), "\n")
cat("Metadata features:", ncol(metadata), "\n")
```

### Data cleaning

#### Filtering cell types

To focus our analysis, we retain only the three most abundant cell types.

```{r}
# Select the three most expressed cell types
top_3_ct <- names(sort(table(metadata$label), decreasing = TRUE)[1:3])
cell_filter <- metadata$label %in% top_3_ct
metadata <- metadata[cell_filter,]
counts <- counts[, cell_filter]

cat("Remaining cells after filtering:", nrow(metadata), "\n")
```

#### Filtering Low-Expression Genes

We remove genes with extremely low expression to improve statistical power.

```{r}
# Keep only genes with expression in at least some cells
counts <- counts[rowSums(counts) > 500,]
cat("Remaining genes after filtering:", nrow(counts), "\n")
```

### Setting up the Design matrix

The design matrix specifies the experimental conditions for each cell:

```{r}
# Create design matrix based on biological conditions
design_matrix <- model.matrix(~label, data = metadata)

# View unique conditions in your data
print(unique(metadata$label))
```

### Model fitting

Next, we fit the statistical model to the filtered dataset using the `devil::fit_devil()` function.

```{r}
fit <- devil::fit_devil(
  as.matrix(counts),
  design_matrix,
  overdispersion = TRUE,
  size_factors = TRUE, 
  init_overdispersion = 100,
  verbose = TRUE,
  parallel.cores = 1, 
  offset = 1e-6
)
```
### Testing for Differential Expression

#### Understanding Contrast Vectors

In order to test the data you need to specify your null hypothesis using a contrast vector $c$. Considering a gene $g$ along with its inferred coefficient $\beta_g$, the null hypothesis $H_0$ is usually defined as

$$ H_0 : \sum_i c_i \beta_{g,i} = 0$$
For example, if you are interested in the genes that are differentially expressed between the "beta" and "ductal" cell types, you need to find the genes for which we strongly reject the null hypothesis 

$$ \beta_{beta} = \beta_{ductal} \hspace{5mm} \rightarrow \hspace{5mm} \beta_{beta} - \beta_{ductal} = 0$$

which is equivalent to defining the contrast vector $c = (0,1,-1)$.
Once the contrast vector is defined, you can test the null hypothesis using the `test_de` function.

```{r}
# Test differential expression between conditions
contrast <- c(0, 1, -1)
test_results <- devil::test_de(fit, contrast, max_lfc = 20)

# Add gene names if missing
if (!('name' %in% colnames(test_results))) {
  test_results$name <- as.character(1:nrow(test_results))
}
```

The test results include:

- `pval` : raw p-value
- `adj_pval` : adjusted p-value (corrected for multiple testing)
- `lfc` : log2 fold change between conditions

#### Visualizing Results

Create a volcano plot to visualize significant genes

```{r}
devil::plot_volcano(
  test_results,
  lfc_cut = 1,          # Log fold-change cutoff
  pval_cut = 0.05,      # P-value significance threshold
  labels = TRUE,        # Show gene labels
  point_size = 2
)
```

### Conclusion 

In this tutorial, we covered the essential workflow for differential expression analysis using the devil package, including:

- Loading and preprocessing scRNA-seq data
- Filtering low-quality genes and selecting cell types
- Constructing a design matrix for statistical modeling
- Fitting the devil model and testing for differential expression
- Visualizing significant results with a volcano plot
