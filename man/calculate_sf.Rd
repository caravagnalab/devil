\title{Calculate Size Factors for Count Data Normalization}
\usage{
calculate_sf(Y, method = c("normed_sum", "psinorm", "edgeR"), verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Count data matrix with genes in rows and samples in columns}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the normalization method. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"normed_sum"} (default): Geometric mean normalization based on
library sizes
\item \code{"psinorm"}: Psi-normalization using Pareto distribution MLE
\item \code{"edgeR"}: edgeR's TMM with singleton pairing method
}}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print progress messages}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of size factors, one per sample (column). Size factors
are scaled to have a geometric mean of 1.
}
\description{
Computes normalization factors for count data using one of three
methods: geometric mean normalization (normed_sum), psi-normalization
(psinorm), or edgeR's TMM with singleton pairing (edgeR). Handles edge cases
like all-zero columns and matrices with too few rows.
}
\details{
Size factors are used to normalize count data for differences in sequencing
depth and RNA composition across samples. The function will return a vector
of 1s if the input matrix has only one row.

The \code{"normed_sum"} method computes size factors as the column sums
divided by their geometric mean.

The \code{"psinorm"} method uses maximum likelihood estimation of Pareto
distribution parameters to compute size factors robust to highly variable
genes.

The \code{"edgeR"} method requires the edgeR package to be installed and
uses the TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) method with singleton pairing.
